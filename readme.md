# Handwritten Character Recognition

A Handwritten Character Recognition Model using a CRNN model with a CTC Loss.
This project is in progress.

## Training
To train the model:
1. Download the dataset from [here](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/DBs/iamDB/data) (You might have to register [here](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/DBs/iamDB/iLogin/index.php) first).
2. Copy the dataset into `data/original`
